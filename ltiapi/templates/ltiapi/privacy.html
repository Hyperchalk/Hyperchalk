<h1>{% trans "Privacy" %}</h1>

  As we value your privacy, it is of our deepest interest to tell you which data is collected in
  this application.

<h2>{% trans "Collected Data" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}
  This application tracks every cursor movement of the collaborators and every change to the elements
  on the board, as well as information on connections and disconnections to the board. All those data
  points carry timestamps. It also has a user database, where a user record is automatically created
  from the information supplied by your Learning Management System when you log in via LTI. This record
  contains your user name, your real name that is provided by the LMS, a user ID and the ID of the LMS
  that you used.

  However, we do not link you to the stored actions directly. Instead, we create a pseudonym for you
  on every board which is then stored in an association table. This table can be deleted at any time
  to restore your anonymity. We need this to assign your pseudonyms to your pre- and
  post-tests during learning indicator evaluation. We can also delete your entries in this table,
  which has the effect that, while individual changes can still be traced back to the actions of
  a single person per board, you cannot be tracked across multiple boards if your user record is
  also deleted from the database.
