abstract="In e-learning, collaborative online whiteboards have become a popular choice for implementing collaborative learning. However, existing solutions fail to deliver data in a way that allows for the application of learning analytics in this field. While the market offers several solutions, most of them cannot be integrated with existing learning management systems and do not provide data that can be used for learning analytics. To overcome this, we implement a digital collaborative whiteboard based on the open source Excalidraw and a custom back-end. The whiteboard can be self-hosted, it collects rich log data appropriate for learning analytics purposes and it integrates with learning management systems -- such as Moodle -- using the LTI 1.3 Advantage standard.",
