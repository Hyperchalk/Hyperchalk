# anyway as the channels backend, you may want to just use it for caching, too.

# Channel Layers
# https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/channel_layers.html
#
# Channels layers are the layer which the websocket interface uses to communicate between different
# websocket connections. By default, this uses the in memory layer. This should however not be used
# in production, as it does not allow communication between threads and processes. If you plan to
# run the app with only one thread in one process, this is fine. Otherwise it could happen that the
# clients trying to connect to the same room land in different threads, which would lead to the same
# room being created twice with diverging local copies and either of the copies being saved to the
# room table alternatingly.
#
# To prevent this from happening, use either the Redis layer [1][2], the layers implementation for
# postgres [2] or any other layers implementation that suits your needs.
